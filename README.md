# HotCold

The HotCold app was created in mind of helping users get back to their original starting location - whether that be a parking spot, a designated meeting spot at a theme park, etc.

This app is a final independent project

## Behind the App
Creating this app have allowed me to show case all of the skills that I have learned. While developing this app, I tried to ensure that this app was simple in functionality and design.

What I hope to accomplish in future verisons of this app:
- A daytime mode which will incorporate a brighter color scheme
- The ability to share and view locations of others
- The ability to save more than one location
